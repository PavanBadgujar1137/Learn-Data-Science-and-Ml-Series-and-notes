# Machine Learning is a making the computer yo learn from studying data and statistics. this is a program that anayses data and learns to predicts the outcome. 

# Where to start : here for calculations importatnt numbers based on data sets we used mathematics and for studying statistics. and using the various python modules..
# Data Set: [99,86,87,43,56,76,45,35,89,77,99,78,66,55,87,67]

# Data type: there are 3 types of main category of data type in ML:
# Numerical: 1)Discrete Data: numbers that are limited to integer like number of cars passing by a road.
# 2) Continous Data : Number that are of infinite value like price of an item.
# Catogorical Data: the values that cannot be count or measured like color.
# Ordinal Data : these are like categorical data but can be measured or countable like schoool grades A is better than B.
